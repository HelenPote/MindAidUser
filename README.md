# MindAidUser

## What

A mental health web app for Teachers

## Why

Teachers have very infrequent refesher courses on how to deal with pupil mental health,

Wouldn't it be great if there was an up to date resource out there with great resources and 

links of what are the best places to find information

## How

We are going to have easily navigatible and well displayed information on the best and latest resources to use

We are going to have a link to an sdq questionaire site as they have not allowed us to use their questionaire within our site

## For developers

To get started:

`git clone https://github.com/MindAidPrototype/MindAidUser && cd MindAidUser && npm i && npm start`

Visit: `http://localhost:3000`
